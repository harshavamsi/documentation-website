# Upgrade OpenSearch - Docker

The OpenSearch Project is continually releasing updates that include new features and bug fixes. OpenSearch uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), which means that breaking changes are only introduced between major version releases. All minor versions in the same major version release are compatible.

To learn about upcoming features and fixes, review the [OpenSearch Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/opensearch-project/projects/1) on GitHub. To see a lit of previous releases, or to learn more about how OpenSearch uses versioning, check out the [Release Schedule and Maintenance Policy]({{site.url}}/releases.html).
