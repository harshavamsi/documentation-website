# Install and configure OpenSearch

OpenSearch has the following installation options:

- [Docker]

OpenSearch does not support direct version downgrades. If your environment must be downgraded, we recommend using snapshots to create a restore point, then restoring the snapshot to a cluster built with the target version. To learn more about restore points, see [Restore snapshots]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/snapshots/snapshot-restore#restore-snapshots).
